# Welcome to Pi Calculator!

This is a program that I originally made in Scratch and I now have converted it into a Java Program!
In order to use this you have to download the zip, unzip it and run the Run.bat file and there you go! (Make sure you use java verion jdk-14.0.2* or this won't work)


*I will try to update this to the latest java version.
